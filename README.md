Native Client Platform for Visual Studio 2010
=============================================

This adds native support for building NaCl executables to Visual Studio 2010 by integrating NaCl SDK GCC tool-chain into MSBuild system.
It is basically a hacked version of [vs-android](http://code.google.com/p/vs-android/).
Giant thanks to Gavin Pugh for making this possible.

How to install
==============

Copy 'NaCl' directory to 'C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\Platforms'.
